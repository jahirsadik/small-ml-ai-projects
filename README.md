# Small ML & AI Projects

This repository contains various small projects focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts. Each folder showcases a different approach to a specific problem.

## Project Overview

### Getting Started With Titanic
This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts survival based on passenger characteristics. It explores data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques.

### Mall Customer Segmentation Data (K-Means Clustering)
This project employs K-Means clustering on mall customer data to identify distinct customer segments. It demonstrates data visualization and the effectiveness of clustering algorithms in understanding customer behaviors.

### Prolog Intro
This folder contains introductory Prolog code, focusing on basic concepts and programming paradigms. It covers facts, rules, and queries to solve logical problems.

### Heart Disease Project
This project utilizes a dataset to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. It involves data analysis, feature engineering, and building classification models to assess patient risk.

## Conclusion

These projects illustrate my growing understanding of machine learning and AI principles.
